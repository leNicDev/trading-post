# Verto Trading Post

Verto is a decentralized token exchange protocol built on [Arweave](https://arweave.org) powered by a network of trading posts. The following documentation contains the information necessary to start up a trading post of your own.

## Prerequisites

Before initializing your trading post, ensure that you have [VRT](https://community.xyz/#usjm4PCxUd5mtaon7zc97-dt-3qf67yPyqgzLnLqk5A/tokens) staked in your wallet. Without staked VRT, users will be unable to discover your trading post on the exchange.
