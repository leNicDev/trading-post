## Start a trading post

Starting your trading post is as simple as:

```shell script
verto
```

If you want to start without having copying your keyfile to the project root, you can run with:

```shell script
verto -k keyfile.json
```

Congratulations! You've successfully started a verto trading post! ðŸ¦”

You can also [set up a reverse proxy](./docs/PROXY.md) with `nginx` for hosting your API.
